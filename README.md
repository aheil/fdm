# The not-so-ultimate collection fo FDM printing tips

Welcome to my collection of FDM printing information. 

There are tons of videos, tips and dokumentations out there. Eventually, I started bookmarking everything I found. However, in this mess of inforamtion, it is sometimes hard to find the inforamtion. Therefore, I decided to pull everything I`ve learned together in this place.
