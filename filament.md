# Filament 

I tried various vendors for my projects. Here are some of my experiences.

## Anycubic 

Anycubic used to provide a very good standard PLA and PLA+ filament. No stringing, not sticky no layer lines, worked for very long bridges. It seemed to me the best standard PLA for a very good price. 

**2024 Anycubic changed their standard filament. It shows a lot of stringing and very sticky.**

### Anycubic PLA (2024)

**OrcaSlicer Settings**

Temp: 205Â°C  
 
Flow Rate: 1,09  
Retraction Length 0,7mm  
Volumetric Speed: 12  

**Printing Issues**

For unknown reasons, the filament caused a lot of pillowing.
While the flow rate test showed a flow rate of 1,05 the best result, with OrcaSlicers new YOLO test, I figured out, that 1,09 provided much better results - including pillowing disapearing.

While the tests showed me tu use 195 for the nozzle temperature, printing results seemed to be quite bad in terms of stringing. Increains the emerpature to 205 almost removed the stringing.
