# Filament 

## Vendors 

I tried various vendors for my projects. Here are some of my experiences.

### Anycubic 

Anycubic used to provide a very good standard PLA and PLA+ filament. No stringing, not sticky no layer lines, worked for very long bridges. It seemed to me the best standard PLA for a very good price. 

**2024 Anycubic changed their standard filament. It shows a lot of stringing and very sticky.**
