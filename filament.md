# Filament 

## Vendors 

I tried various vendors for my projects. Here are some of my experiences.

### Anycubic 

Anycubic proveded a very good standard PLA and PLA+ filament. No stringing, not sticky no layerlines, worked for very long bridges. 
2024 Anycubic changed their standard filament. It shows a lot of stringing and very sticky.
