# Filament 

I tried various vendors for my projects. Here are some of my experiences.

## Anycubic 

Anycubic used to provide a very good standard PLA and PLA+ filament. No stringing, not sticky no layer lines, worked for very long bridges. It seemed to me the best standard PLA for a very good price. 

**2024 Anycubic changed their standard filament. It shows a lot of stringing and very sticky. After some testing, I came to following "sort-of-ok" settings.**

### Anycubic PLA (2024)

|Setting|Value| 
| --- | --- |
| Temp | 205°C |
| Flow Rate | 1.09 |
| Retraction Length | 0.7mm |
| Volumetric Speed | 12 |

**Printing Issues**

For unknown reasons, the filament caused a lot of pillowing.
While the flow rate test showed a flow rate of 1,05 the best result, with OrcaSlicers new YOLO test, I figured out, that 1,09 provided much better results - including pillowing disapearing.

While the tests showed me to use 195°C for the nozzle temperature, printing results seemed to be quite bad in terms of stringing. Increasing the temerpature to 205°C almost removed the stringing.
